# HR-Analytics
Welcome to the HR Analytics dataset-based learning section: Job Change of Data Scientists  Let's recall the context: a company seeks to recruit data scientists among those who have passed their exams/interviews. We try to find out among those who have applied, which candidates really want to join the company or which ones are looking to join another company. This prediction helps reduce training costs and plan candidate categorization.  This database, cleaned and analyzed previously in the cleaning and analytics sections, is respectively composed of 8955 rows and 14 columns with a train/test split of 80-20%. Among the different columns, we were able to select the most important features which are displayed below.
